/*

COde-ReUser:
All subclasses can execute methods even though the code is declared on the parent class.
The code doesn't have to be duplicated in each subclass.
We can use code from the parent.
Or we can change that code for the subclass

Overidding Method:
Overriding a method is when you create a method on a subclass, which has the same signature as a method on a super class.
You override a parent class method when you want the child class to show different behavior for that method.
