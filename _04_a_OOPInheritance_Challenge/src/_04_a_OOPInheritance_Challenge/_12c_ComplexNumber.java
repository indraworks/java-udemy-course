jadi yg ini utk misal utk x =2+3j 
x2 = 6-3j 
nah yg real = 2+6;
yg imaginer 3-3;
nah utk kata j imajiner itu gak ikut ditambahkan itu simbol ngasih tau aja
itu imaginer bilangan!

//////////Fields:

real and imaginary are declared as private to ensure encapsulation.
Constructor:

Initializes the real and imaginary fields based on the provided values.
Getter Methods:

getReal: Returns the real part of the complex number.
getImaginary: Returns the imaginary part of the complex number.
Add Methods:

One method takes real and imaginary values directly and adds them to the current fields.
The other method takes a ComplexNumber object and adds its real and imaginary values to the current fields.
Subtract Methods:

One method takes real and imaginary values directly and subtracts them from the current fields.
The other method takes a ComplexNumber object and subtracts its real 
and imaginary values from the current fields.

Adding the Symbol "i" for Display Purposes
If you want to include i when printing or displaying the result 
(to make it look like a real mathematical expression), you can customize the output.
 Here's how you can modify the ComplexNumber class:

@Override
public String toString() {
    return real + " + " + imaginary + "i";
}
Example Usage with toString
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ComplexNumber one = new ComplexNumber(1.0, 1.0);
        ComplexNumber number = new ComplexNumber(2.5, -1.5);

        one.add(1, 1); 
        System.out.println("Complex Number One: " + one);

        one.subtract(number);
        System.out.println("After Subtracting Number: " + one);

        number.subtract(one);
        System.out.println("Number After Subtracting One: " + number);
    }
}
Output
Complex Number One: 2.0 + 2.0i
After Subtracting Number: -0.5 + 3.5i
Number After Subtracting One: 3.0 + -5.0i
Explanation of toString
The toString method overrides the default object-to-string conversion and allows you to format the output however you like.
In this case, we format the output as real + imaginary i.
This approach ensures that the i is included when displaying results, 
but it doesn't interfere with the actual math operations, which are purely numerical. 
This way, you get the correct representation without adding complexity to your calculations.
